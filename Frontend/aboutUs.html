    Carpooling is an arrangement in which a group of people commute together by car. Generally, the passengers alternate driving duties. Carpooling can save on costs such as fuel and parking, because the expenses are shared among the participants.

    Carpooling became popular during World War II, when gasoline was rationed.

    The ride is usually pre-planned; the driver and the passengers do not charge each other but may chip in for gas. Carpooling entails sharing a ride with other riders who have similar travel needs. Carpools are sometimes organized through employers or communities, but can also be arranged spontaneously by those who need to get somewhere fast. Carpools are one of the most effective ways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as well as save money on fuel costs.
    <br><br>
    Since then it has lost popularity but has seen a resurgence in recent years with rising gas prices, as well as environmental awareness.
